// NOTE:
// Unfortunately, our global styles are not automatically available in sass files. So, we have
// to manually import them every time. But, the Vite setup I shared will save you from worrying about
// constructing relative paths every time, and prevent any issues if you move your styling files to a
// different location.
// Also, unlike the compiler options from Vue projects built with the Vue CLI, there are no issues with
// using the latest @use syntax instead of the deprecated @import syntax.
